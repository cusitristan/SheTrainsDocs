Hormone cycles naturally change your body's capacity for training, so syncing your training with your body is an obvious next step for any professional athlete looking to step up their game. The menstrual cycle can be split into four different phases:
- Menstrual Phase
- Follicular Phase
- Ovulation Phase
- Luteal Phase

These four phases have very different effects on your body. For optimal performance, strength, and injury prevention, you should adjust your training plans to suit your body's needs. For example, scientific studies have shown that ACL injuries are more likely to occur during the luteal phase. Make sure take extra care of your knee during this time!
