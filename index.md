# Welcome to SheTrains Product Page!
SheTrains is an athlete management tool for high-level athletic coaches. SheTrains offers a period tracking mobile application for athletes and a web-based dashboard and visualizations application for coaches.

## :trophy: Motivations
   1. We want athletes to train harder and safer so they can excel in their sport and win competitions. We are commited to seeing SheTrainers rise above their expectations!
   2. We want to raise awareness and eliminate the stigma around discussing menstrual cycles, especially when it comes to athletes and their training.
   3. We want to empower athletes and coaches to harness the body's natural capacity for growth rather than making them fight against the body.

## :weight_lifting_woman: What is SheTrains and how does it help?
SheTrains is both a mobile app for Andriod and iOS and a web-based app.

The mobile app is a period cycle tracker and is designed for athletes. Using the app, athletes can easily track their period symptoms. The process is streamlined, so athletes don't have to worry about fumbling with their phones to input all their data--it really is that easy! The data that athletes input is automatically sent to their coaches to help them make adjustments to training plans.

The web-based app is a dashboard of visualizations powered by the athlete's data and the best scientific evidence available! Coaches can track their athletes' menstrual cycles and symptoms, and use the insightful visualizations to adjust their training plans to perfectly match their athlete's condition. 

SheTrains builds a bridge between athletes and coaches. Using SheTrains, coaches can learn more about how an athlete's period affects them and can quickly remind their athletes to track their symptoms.

SheTrains helps athletes be more in touch with their body than ever before.
