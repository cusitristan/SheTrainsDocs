# Welcome to SheTrains Product Page!
SheTrains is the first mentrual and fitness tracker for professional athletes helping you reach your goals faster than the competition.

## :bulb: About
Hormone cycles naturally change your bodies ability to train so syncing your training with your body is an obvious next step for any professional athlete looking to step up their game. The menstrual cycle can be split into four different phases:
- Menstrual Phase
- Follicular Phase
- Ovulation Phase
- Luteal Phase

These four phases have very different effects on your body and for optimal performance and strength plus injury prevention one should alter their training schedule to follow what their body needs. As an example the studies have shown that ACL injuries are more likely to occure during the luteal phase.

### :trophy: Motivations
   1. We want athletes to train harder and with less injuries so they can excel in their sport and win competitions. We are commited to seeing SheTrainers rise above their expectations and soon hope to prove with hard data that our product works. 
   2. We want to raise awareness and take down the stigma around discussing menstrual cycles especially when it comes to athletes and their training.
   3. We want to be the number one recognized training app for professionals 

### :weight_lifting_woman: What is SheTrains and how does it Help?
SheTrains is a mobile app for Andriod and IOS and is a fitness planner that takes your hormone cycle into account and provides actionable advice to improve your training schedule. 

The app also builds a bridge from athlete to coach so coaches can view the athletes cycles and makes adjustments to their training based on that information.

With SheTrains, athletes can track their training as well as their mentrual cycle and they get customized advice based on their inputs. As default we look towards the latest studies in scientific literature to help athletes understand what the science says about training with your hormone phases. 

SheTrains helps athletes be more in touch with their body than ever before.
